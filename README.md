# Literal Dogwater Library

### Introduction
This is the "Literal Dogwater Library", a Java library that aims to implement
a lot of functionalities found in so-called "Cursed Code" or
"Programing War crimes" YouTube Videos. These are typically
either really stupid or just completely redundant,
but in most cases they are both. Enjoy!

### Features
- test(): string
- isOdd(): bool
- isTrue(bool): bool
- isFalse(bool): bool
- math functions (add,subtract,multiply,divide)
- rickRoll(): string() (url)

### Currently Planned Features

- stringLength(string): int
- sortArray(var[]):var[] (Bogosort)
- fizzbuzz(int): string
- Bullshitery with strings
- brainfuck(string): string

### Why, just why?
- Honestly, just for the lols
